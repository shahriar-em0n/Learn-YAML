# YAML Learning Journey ðŸ§ 
Welcome to my **YAML Learning Repository**!  
This repo documents my journey of learning YAML â€” the "Yet Another Markup Language" thatâ€™s widely used for configuration files, automation tools, and data serialization.

## ðŸ“˜ What is YAML?

**YAML** stands for **YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language**.  
Itâ€™s a **human-readable data format** often used for:
- Configuration files (`.yml`, `.yaml`)
- Kubernetes manifests
- GitHub Actions workflows
- CI/CD pipelines
- API definitions (like OpenAPI/Swagger)

Example:
```yaml
name: Example
version: 1.0
languages:
  - Go
  - Python
  - JavaScript

## Learning Goals

- Understand YAML syntax and indentation rules

- Learn about lists, dictionaries, and nested data

- Use YAML in real-world tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and Kubernetes

- Practice writing clean and valid YAML files
